## 2.1 Processing Overview

Each module or component INF file is broken out into sections in a manner
similar to the other build meta-data files. However, the intent of a module's
INF file is to define the source files, libraries, and definitions relevant to
building the module, creating binary files that are either raw binary files or
PE32/PE32+/coff format files. The different sections are described in detail in
this chapter. EDK II parsing utilities are token based, which permits an element 
to span multiple lines. The EDK II utilities check EDK II INF files, and, if required, 
generate C code files based on the content of the EDK II INF. Refer to 
the _EDK II Build Specification_ for more information regarding these autogenerated files.

All EDK II INF files MUST use this forward slash character for all directory
paths specified.
