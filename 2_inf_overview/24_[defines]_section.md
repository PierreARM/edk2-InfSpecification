## 2.4 [Defines] Section

This is a required section.

The `[Defines]` section of EDK II INF files is used to define variable
assignments that can be used in later build steps. The INF_VERSION of existing
INF files does not need to be updated unless content in the file has been
updated to match new content specified by this revision of the specification.

Architectural modifiers are not permitted in the [Defines] section.

The parsing utilities process any local symbol assignments defined in this
section. The

EDK II parsing utilities will use some of this section's information for
generating `AutoGen.c` and `AutoGen.h` files. Note that the sections are
processed in the order listed in the INF file, and later assignments of these
local symbols override previous assignments.

`[Defines]`

The format for entries in this section is:

`Name = Value`

The following is an example of a driver's `[Defines]` section.

```ini
[Defines]
  INF_VERSION     = 0x0001001B
  BASE_NAME       = DxeIpl
  FILE_GUID       = 86D70125-BAA3-4296-A62F-602BEBBB9081
  VERSION_STRING  = 1.0
  MODULE_TYPE     = PEIM
  ENTRY_POINT     = PeimInitializeDxeIpl
  MODULE_UNI_FILE = DxeIpl.uni
```

The following is an example of a library's `[Defines]` section.

```ini
[Defines]
  INF_VERSION    = 1.27
  BASE_NAME      = BaseMemoryLib
  FILE_GUID      = fd44e603-002a-4b29-9f5f-529e815b6165
  MODULE_TYPE    = BASE
  VERSION_STRING = 1.0
  LIBRARY_CLASS  = BaseMemoryLib
```

Drivers may expose library functionality, such as a `DXE_CORE` module that may
implement functions that satisfy the BaseMemoryAllocation library class. In
this instance, the driver module would also specify the `LIBRARY_CLASS` in the
`[Defines]` section. Other DXE drivers that would require a library instance for
the `BaseMemoryAllocation` class could specify the `DXE_CORE` INF file as the
recommended instance for satisfying the required library class instance.

Appendix G lists the available `MODULE_TYPE` values supported by EDK II INF
files.

The EDK II `[Defines]` section is common to all architectures and does not
permit using architectural modifiers in the section tag name.

The following table shows EDK II unique elements of a defines section that
may be required for generating the `AutoGen.c` and `AutoGen.h` files. Library
modules must never specify driver elements.

**********
**Note:** Any lines not starting with one of the tag names defined in the table
below are added to the top of the INF's generated makefile exactly as typed on
the line in the INF file.
**********
**Note:** `COMBINED_PEIM_DRIVER` is a driver that may be dispatched by either
the PEI Core or the Dxe Core. EDK II only references the first possible
dispatch instance.
