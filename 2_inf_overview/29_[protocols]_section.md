## 2.9 [Protocols] Section

The `[Protocols]` section of the EDK II INF file is a list of the global
Protocol C Names that are used by the module developer. These C names are used
by the parsing utility to lookup the actual GUID value of the PROTOCOL that is
located in the EDK II package DEC files, and then emit a data structure to the
module's `AutoGen.c` file.

Protocols listed in architectural sections must not be listed in common
`[Protocols]` sections. The architectural section modifier is used as a
restriction to mask items from architectures that are not applicable.

This section uses one of the following section definitions:

```ini
[Protocols]
[Protocols.common]
[Protocols.IA32]
[Protocols.X64]
[Protocols.EBC]
```

The formats for entries in this section is:

`gEfiProtocolCName [ | FeatureFlagExpression] ## Usage comment`

When a `FeatureFlagExpression` is present, if the expression evaluates to
`TRUE`, then the Protocal entry is valid. If the expression evaluates to
`FALSE`, then the EDK II build tools must ignore the entry.

The following is an example of the `[Protocols]` section.

```ini
[Protocols]
  gEfiDecompressProtocolGuid
  gEfiLoadFileProtocolGuid
```
